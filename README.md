# 30 Days of Rust

I had an idea. I like code. I like learning. I like writing.
So what I'm going to do is learn some Rust language and document the process.

From day 1 to 30.

There will be links to blogs and people to follow along the way.
And of course correct me when I'm wrong.

Inspired by Zbigniew Siciarz's book [24daysofrust](https://zsiciarz.github.io/24daysofrust/index.html)
